Only use terminal_name when you need a genuinely separate terminal for parallel execution (e.g. a background dev server running alongside normal commands). Do not create named terminals for one-off commands.\n\nTerminal splitting: Use split_from with a terminal_id or terminal_name to create a new terminal split alongside an existing one, forming a visual group in VS Code's terminal panel. Only affects new terminal creation \u2014 if the target terminal_name already exists and is idle, it is reused without re-splitting.\n\nBackground commands: Use background=true for long-running processes (dev servers, watch modes). Returns immediately with terminal_id. Use get_terminal_output with the terminal_id to check on progress, read accumulated output, and see if the command has finished. Background terminals are never auto-reused \u2014 always use terminal_name or terminal_id to target them.\n\nOutput is capped to the last 200 lines by default. Full output is saved to a temp file (returned as output_file) for on-demand access via read_file. Use output_head, output_tail, or output_grep to customize filtering. IMPORTANT: Commands that pipe through head, tail, or grep (e.g. `cmd | head -5`) will be automatically REJECTED. Use the output_head, output_tail, and output_grep parameters instead \u2014 they filter the output returned to you while keeping the full output visible to the user in the terminal.\n\nInteractive commands: Commands that require interactive input (editors like vim/nano, REPLs without scripts, TUI apps like htop, bare database CLIs, interactive git flags like -i/-p, scaffolders without --yes) will be automatically REJECTED with a helpful suggestion. Always use non-interactive alternatives: pass -y/--yes flags, use -c/-e for inline execution, provide all arguments upfront, or use the appropriate agentlink tool (write_file, apply_diff) instead of editors.",
