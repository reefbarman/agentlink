## Prefer AgentLink MCP tools

When the `agentlink` MCP server is available, prefer its tools over built-in equivalents. AgentLink tools work through VS Code directly, providing diff views, integrated terminal, real diagnostics, and language server intelligence.

### Tool mappings

If your agent has built-in filesystem tools, prefer the agentlink equivalents:

| Built-in | AgentLink equivalent | Why |
|---|---|---|
| File read | `read_file` | Returns line numbers, file metadata, git status, and diagnostics summary |
| File edit/write | `apply_diff` / `write_file` | Opens a diff view for user review. Format-on-save applies automatically. Returns user edits and diagnostics. |
| Shell/terminal | `execute_command` | Runs in VS Code's integrated terminal (visible to user). Captures output via shell integration. Supports named terminals for parallel tasks. |
| File search/glob | `list_files` | Lists files with optional recursive + depth control |
| Content search/grep | `search_files` | Ripgrep-powered search with context lines. Also supports semantic/vector search. |

### Terminal behavior

`execute_command` automatically reuses an existing idle terminal. You do NOT need to pass `terminal_name` or `terminal_id` for normal sequential commands — just omit both and the tool will reuse the default terminal.

- **DO NOT** pass `terminal_name` unless you specifically need a *separate* terminal (e.g. a long-running dev server alongside normal commands, or truly parallel tasks).
- `terminal_id` is only needed if a previous background command returned one and you need to interact with that specific terminal.
- Use `background: true` for long-running processes (dev servers, watch modes). Returns immediately with `terminal_id`. Use `get_terminal_output` with the `terminal_id` to check on progress.
- Use `split_from` with a `terminal_id` or `terminal_name` to create a new terminal split alongside an existing one.
- After a session, use `close_terminals` to clean up any stale terminals.
- Always use non-interactive flags where available (e.g. `--yes`, `-y`, `--no-input`) as interactive commands are automatically rejected.
- **Always set a `timeout`** for commands you expect to complete quickly (e.g. git, ls, npm test — use 10-30s). Only omit timeout for long-running processes.

### File editing notes

- After writing files, check the response for `diagnostics` and `user_edits`.
- If `user_edits` is present, the user modified your proposed changes — read the patch to understand what they changed.
- Use `get_diagnostics` for real VS Code errors/warnings from language services.

### Additional tools

AgentLink also provides language server tools with no built-in equivalent. Use these proactively — they give you real language server intelligence instead of guessing from source text.

- **`go_to_definition`** — Jump to where a symbol is defined. Takes a file, line, and column.
- **`go_to_implementation`** — Find concrete implementations of an interface, abstract class, or method.
- **`go_to_type_definition`** — Navigate to the type definition of a symbol.
- **`get_references`** — Find all usages of a symbol across the workspace.
- **`get_symbols`** — Get document symbol outline (pass `path`) or search workspace symbols (pass `query`).
- **`get_hover`** — Get inferred types and documentation for a symbol at a position.
- **`get_completions`** — Get autocomplete suggestions at a cursor position.
- **`get_code_actions`** + **`apply_code_action`** — Get available quick fixes and refactorings, then apply one by index.
- **`get_call_hierarchy`** — Get incoming callers and/or outgoing callees for a function.
- **`get_type_hierarchy`** — Get supertypes and subtypes of a type.
- **`get_inlay_hints`** — Get inferred type annotations and parameter names for a range of lines.
- **`get_diagnostics`** — Get real VS Code diagnostics (errors, warnings) for a file or the whole workspace.
- **`rename_symbol`** — Rename a symbol across the entire workspace using the language server.
- **`open_file`** — Open a file in the VS Code editor, optionally scrolling to a specific line.
- **`show_notification`** — Show a notification in VS Code. Use sparingly.
- **`codebase_search`** — Semantic search over the codebase using vector similarity.
- **`find_and_replace`** — Bulk find-and-replace across multiple files using a glob pattern.
- **`get_terminal_output`** — Check on a background command started with `execute_command` + `background: true`.
